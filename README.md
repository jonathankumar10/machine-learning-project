# Project topic
N.L.P. model to guestimate ratings of a movie based on reviews.

# Project description
Create an NLP based model to understand the polarity of review and estimate a rating based on the review provided to a movie. Post we train a model to identify the polarity of review we will try to create a regression or classification model to map the review to a rating from range of 1-10.

# Timeline
- [x] Data collection: (0 -weeks)
Large movie review: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ (Links to an external site.)

- [x] Prepare the input data: (2-3-weeks)
We will go through the movie review dataset and get the rating, review, polarity of review as a pre requisite to create the dataset as per our required input for model. We will remove certain stop words because they are considered sentiment neutral. Also perform a few preliminary processes like tokenization, Parts of speech recognition, Lemmatization, etc.        

- [x] Analyse the input data: (1 - week)
We will analyse the dataset by getting a word frequency count, to limit our vocabulary to certain amount of words and understand the grammar involved in the reviews.

- [ ] Training an algorithm: (2-3 weeks)
Most of our time will be invested in the cleaning process of the dataset, but a considerable time will be spent on training the model in order to get the maximum efficiency.

- [ ] Evaluate the algorithm: (1 week)
Based on the above process and time limitation, if we have enough time, we might compare our trained model with the ones that, we might come across while finding ways to implement our model.
